        <h1>Programmer, Powerlifter, Photographer</h1>
        <p>Born and raised in Brooklyn. Started programming in a required high school intro CS class and wound up getting a degree at Cornell University, working across the nation in Wisconsin, Silicon Valley, and finally Google NYC.</p>
        <p>Started powerlifting after dabbling in high school wrestling. Learned the importance of form on day 1 and fast forward 5 years, my top lifts to date have been:<br>

        <div>
            <span>
                Squat: 385 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Bench: 265 &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
                Deadlift: 405
            </span>
        </div>
        <p>Started photography the day before a trip to Yosemite in an attempt to capture California's beauty. Ended up taking every shot in auto, which left me yearning to do better. Luckily, got the chance to really up my game during a post-grad trip to Asia which kept the camera glued to my hands everyday for 50 days. (shooting with a Nikon D750 primarily with the 24-70mm)</p>
